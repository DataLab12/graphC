# graphC

**graphC** algorithmm implements the wrapper for the state-of-art (2022) community discovery methods, and measures ARI of the methods on sample data. 

** Automated run on sample data** 
```
>>python run.py
```

The wrapper calls ```graphC.py``` and creates the ARI table for Highland Tribes data. All the Highland signed graph clustering methods are run and outputs saved in the subfolders. 

**Follow [SETUP.md](SETUP.md)** instructions on how to create the ARI table for different dataset.
